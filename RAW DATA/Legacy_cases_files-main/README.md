# Legacy_cases_files

Legacy 'new cases' (positive test results) data snatched from the PHE Dashboard: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk under the Open Government Licence v3.0 (which may not permit making them available to others even for research purposes).

Thanks to nameless others for providing missing files.
